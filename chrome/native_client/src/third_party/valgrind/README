This directory contains valgrind-related files:
  * ./valgrind.h and ./memcheck.h -- public valgrind headers
     needed to communicate NaCl-specific memory management to valgrind.
  * ./bin/* -- pre-built valgrind binaries which can be used with NaCl.
    The memcheck binary is built with native_client/tools/build_memcheck.sh.
    The tsan binary can be updated from TSan buildbot at
        http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/tsan/binaries/
    Look for the latest tsan-rNNNN-amd64-linux-self-contained.sh.
    Alternatively, you can build one yourself with
        make -C tsan OFFLINE= VALGRIND_INST_ROOT=../out \
          VALGRIND_ROOT=../third_party/valgrind OS=linux ARCH=amd64 DEBUG=0 \
          self-contained-stripped
    in ThreadSanitizer source directory, it will be 2 times smaller, because it
    will not include all the x86(32) stuff.
