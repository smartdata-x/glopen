In order to use this with spec2k you will need to:

* copy stuff from a real spec harness via:
  run_all.sh PoplateFromSpecHarness <path-to-real-spec-harness>

* possibly edit the run_all.sh

* run "run_all.sh help" to see the available options

* run  "run_all.sh" to run tests with the default setup

If you want to build pnacl.arm target, should also:

* setup a nacl client and run
  tools/llvm/pnacl-helper.sh download-toolchains
  tools/llvm/pnacl-helper.sh organize-native-code
  tools/llvm/pnacl-helper.sh build-bitcode
